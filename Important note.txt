1. Alway think, can we reduce space ? i.e. do we 
really need that variable or we can get rid of it.

2. For searching item present in an array set can be efficient. It has has() method
which take constant time to check if item exist.

3. Accumulator - This is similar to reduce function. Can be utilised to sum all item or array or
concat a string

4. "for of" loop for iteration over array and "for in" for iteration over object

5. freq counter. When key is clearly mentioned as string and also it is not very huge. go with object
based solution otherwise go with Map based solution.

6. in anagram problems we didn't need to create another object

for (let char of str2) {
    if (!freq[char]) return false; // it does two check. if char exist in another string. there 
    freq[char]--;                  // there frequency is not zero
}

7. Both Set and Map preserve insertion order. Map is useful when you need frequency or additional info

8. digit extraction - We make use of modular operator to get last digit

9. rotating number - We can use slice method

10. sum of a number raniging 1 - n is n*(n+1)/2
